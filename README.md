# Ardiuno Repository

## What I've wrote or collected

This is a collection, mainly for myself, of Arduino code that I've messed with at some point in time, and would like to have to reference in the future.  Everything here was either written myself, or found in public posting on the internet (with no stated license attached).  If there is something that I've found, and it's yours, and you don't want it here, let me know.  Otherwise I hope that myself, and possibly others, will benefit from this collection.

Everything is presented as-is, with no guarntee that it will complie, work, function, and not hurt your cat in the process.

Enjoy,
--Chris
